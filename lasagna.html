    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>

    <p>The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with b√©chamel and meat sauce, is well known. The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. The lasagna you eat depends on where you are. </p>
